# Digit_Recognition_Using_CNN
* This project uses a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented using TensorFlow/Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIst Dataset.
* The model is trained and saved, and a separate script is provided to make predictions on custom images.

# Train Model
Train_Model.py - Run this code to train and save the CNN Model.

# Model
CNN_model.h5 - Saved model generated after training.

# Predict Digit
Predict_Digit.py - Run this code to load the model and predict digits from the images.

# Requirements

Install the required Python libraries using pip:

'pip3 install tensorflow keras matplotlib numpy'
